## Maintaining the Libraries

### Synchronizing Library Versions

- see [build.gradle](build.gradle) for the list of repos, versions and replacement regexes
- adjust the config
- if the directories are checked out already next to this repo, make sure, the right branches (`master`) are checked out, and all changes are committed
- run `gradle` or `./gradlew`
- alternatively, run `gradle syncVersions` without checking out automatically
- review and commit the repos

### Travis to Bintray

Create a `.travis.yml` file with build statements. You must create a `deploy.key` in this file using the following command-line tool:

```
travis encrypt <YOUR BINTRAY API KEY> --add deploy.key
```
You get your Bintray API key from your Bintray user user profile:

```
  Username-drop-menu > Edit Profile > API Key (left bar menu)
```
